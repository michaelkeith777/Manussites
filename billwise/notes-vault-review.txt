Vault Screen Review:
- The vault screen is rendering beautifully with a dark background
- ZelvariWise branding is showing with gradient text
- Lock icon with gradient background and sparkle animation
- 4-digit passcode entry with circular indicators
- Number pad with 1-9, 0, and Delete buttons
- "Skip for now" link at the bottom
- "Your vault is encrypted and secure" message
- Animated particles visible in background
- No TypeScript errors
- Overall: looks great, professional and fun

Next: Need to check the dashboard and other pages after vault entry
