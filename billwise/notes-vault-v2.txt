Vault V2 Screenshot Review:
The vault screen now shows a spinning dial ring around the lock icon with tick marks. The number pad uses native button elements instead of framer-motion buttons. Delete button shows a backspace icon. The layout looks clean with proper spacing. No TypeScript errors. The vault dial and sparkle animations are visible. Background particles are rendering. Need to verify button clicks work by running tests.
